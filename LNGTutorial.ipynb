        "friendly word for all. We followed him into the kirk, where we found\r\n",
        "ourselves in the presence of quite a large congregation, and sat with\r\n",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie in their own pew in the rear of the kirk. The\r\n",
        "form of the service was quite different from that to which we had been\r\n",
        "accustomed. The congregation stood up while they prayed and sat down\r\n",
        "while they sang the Psalms, with the exception of one man, who remained\r\n",
        "standing in what we thought was the clerk's desk immediately below the\r\n",
        "pulpit. This man acted as leader of the singing, but he failed to get\r\n",
        "much assistance from the people, and had great difficulty in keeping the\r\n",
        "singing going. Possibly the failure of the congregational singing might\r\n",
        "be accounted for by the absence of an organ or other instrument of music\r\n",
        "to assist and encourage the people to sing, the nearest approach to\r\n",
        "anything of the kind being the tuning-fork which the conductor held in\r\n",
        "his hand. There was also the fact that the sitting posture was not the\r\n",
        "best position for bringing out the powers of the human voice; but we\r\n",
        "came to the conclusion that music was not looked upon favourably in that\r\n",
        "remote part of Scotland.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In front of the pulpit there was an enclosure, fenced in by the\r\n",
        "communion rail, and inside this were seated the elders, or deacons of\r\n",
        "the church. These were very old men with bent heads and white hair, and\r\n",
        "had the appearance of centenarians; they were indeed the\r\n",
        "queerest-looking group of old men we had ever seen assembled together.\r\n",
        "But it was their noses that chiefly attracted our attention, as they\r\n",
        "were so very long and crooked, and the strange feature about them was\r\n",
        "that they were all of the same pattern. Their only rival, as far as we\r\n",
        "could see, in length of nose was the minister, but we thought he had\r\n",
        "enlarged his by artificial means, as we found to our surprise that he\r\n",
        "was addicted to snuff-taking, a habit very prevalent in Scotland in\r\n",
        "those days.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Then came the sermon. On the pulpit was the Bible, and beside it a\r\n",
        "substantial box of snuff, to which the minister resorted occasionally in\r\n",
        "the course of his long discourse. His pinches must have been\r\n",
        "considerable, for every sniff lasted from two to three seconds, and\r\n",
        "could be heard distinctly all over the kirk. This had a tendency to\r\n",
        "distract our attention from his sermon, which, by the way, was a very\r\n",
        "good one; but, owing to his rather slow delivery, we experienced a\r\n",
        "feeling of relief when he reached the end, for it had lasted quite an\r\n",
        "hour.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There was now a slight movement amongst the congregation, which we\r\n",
        "interpreted as a sign that the service was at an end, and we rose to\r\n",
        "leave; but, imagine our consternation when our friends told us that what\r\n",
        "we had listened to was only the first part of the service, and that we\r\n",
        "must on no account leave, as the second part was to follow immediately.\r\n",
        "We therefore remained not altogether unwillingly, for we were curious to\r\n",
        "know what the next service was like. It proved to be almost exactly the\r\n",
        "same as the first, and we could not distinguish much difference between\r\n",
        "the two sermons; but we listened attentively, and were convinced that\r\n",
        "the preacher was a thoroughly conscientious man in spite of his\r\n",
        "occasional long sniffs of snuff, which were continued as before, but\r\n",
        "what astonished us was that the old gentleman never once sneezed! It\r\n",
        "was the most remarkable service we had ever attended, and it concluded\r\n",
        "exactly at three o'clock, having lasted three hours.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We had then to retrace our four-mile walk to \"Huna Inn,\" but the miles\r\n",
        "seemed rather longer, as Mrs. Mackenzie could only walk in a leisurely\r\n",
        "manner and we were feeling very hungry. We whiled away the time by\r\n",
        "talking about the sermons and the snuff, but chiefly about the deacons\r\n",
        "and their wonderful noses, and why they were all alike and so strangely\r\n",
        "crooked. Mr. Mackenzie suggested that they were crooked because if they\r\n",
        "had grown straight they would have projected over their mouths and\r\n",
        "prevented them from eating, the crook in them being a provision of\r\n",
        "nature to avoid this; or, they might have descended from the Romans or\r\n",
        "some other ancient race who had formerly inhabited the coast of that\r\n",
        "part of Scotland. Books had been written and sermons preached about\r\n",
        "noses, and the longer the nose the greater the intellect of the owner\r\n",
        "was supposed to be. We told our host that there was only one-sixteenth\r\n",
        "part of an inch between the length of Napoleon's nose and that of\r\n",
        "Wellington's. We had forgotten which was the longer, but as Wellington's\r\n",
        "was so conspicuous that he was nicknamed \"Nosey\" by his troops, and as\r\n",
        "he had won the great battle of Waterloo, we concluded that it was his,\r\n",
        "and gave him the benefit of the doubt. We quoted the following lines:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "  Knows he, that never took a pinch,\r\n",
        "  Nosey, the pleasure thence that flows?\r\n",
        "  Knows he the titillating joy\r\n",
        "  Which my nose knows?\r\n",
        "  O Nose, I am as proud of thee\r\n",
        "  As any mountain of its snows;\r\n",
        "  I gaze on thee, and feel that pride\r\n",
        "  A Roman knows.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Our host confided to us the reason why he was so anxious that we should\r\n",
        "not leave in the middle of the service. The second service was\r\n",
        "originally intended for those who had to come long distances to reach\r\n",
        "the kirk, some of whom came from a place seven miles away, but in late\r\n",
        "years the two services had become continuous. A few Sundays before our\r\n",
        "visit some persons had left the kirk at the end of the first part, and\r\n",
        "in his second sermon the minister had plainly described them as\r\n",
        "followers of the Devil! so we supposed our host was anxious that we\r\n",
        "should not be denounced in the same way.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We found our tea-dinner waiting our arrival at the inn. We sat down to\r\n",
        "it at half-past four, and, as we rose from what was left of it at five\r\n",
        "o'clock, having worked hard meanwhile, we may safely be credited with\r\n",
        "having done our duty.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We had a walk with our host along the shore, and had not proceeded far\r\n",
        "before we saw a dark-looking object some distance away in the sea. We\r\n",
        "thought it looked like a man in a boat, rising and falling with the\r\n",
        "waves, but Mr. Mackenzie told us that it was two whales following the\r\n",
        "herrings that were travelling in shoals round the coasts. We were very\r\n",
        "much interested in their strange movements, as they were the only\r\n",
        "whales we ever saw alive, but we could not help feeling sorry for the\r\n",

        "were again seated before our turf fire, joined by our host and hostess,\r\n",

        "prosperity of the Scottish nation and its representatives in every part\r\n",
        "of the \"wide, wide world\" was attributable to their strict observance of\r\n",

        "Our host and hostess stood watching our departure and waving adieux\r\n",

        "reached the junction of roads where we turned to the left towards Wick.\r\n",

        "representatives of the Groat family, but as these were made two hundred\r\n",
        "years ago, they were now almost illegible. Our road lay through a wild\r\n",

        "in the Parish of Wick, formerly a public-house, and recognised as the\r\n",
        "half-way house between Wick and John o'Groat's. We found it occupied as\r\n",
        "a farm by Mr. John Nicolson, and here we saw the skeleton of a whale\r\n",
        "doing duty as a garden fence. The dead whale, seventy feet in length,\r\n",
        "had been found drifting in the sea, and had been hauled ashore by the\r\n",

        "out of a portion of the backbone, and in the same bone he had also\r\n",

        "some of his paintings, which were really excellent considering they were\r\n",
        "executed in ordinary wall paint. His mother informed us that he began to\r\n",
        "study drawing when he was ill with a slow fever, but not bed-fast. Two\r\n",
        "of the pictures, that of an old bachelor and a Scotch lassie, a servant,\r\n",
        "were very good indeed. We also saw a picture of an old woman, a local\r\n",
        "celebrity, about a hundred years old, which was considered to be an\r\n",
        "excellent likeness, and showed the old lady's eyes so sunk in her head\r\n",
        "as to be scarcely visible. We considered that we had here found one of\r\n",
        "Nature's artists, who would probably have made a name for himself if\r\n",
        "given the advantages so many have who lack the ability, for he certainly\r\n",
        "possessed both the imaginative faculty and no small degree of dexterity\r\n",
        "in execution. He pointed out to us the house of a farmer over the way\r\n",
        "who slept in the Parish of Wick and took his meals in that of Canisbay,\r\n",
        "the boundary being marked by a chimney in the centre of the roof. He\r\n",

        "mile and a half to view it. He warned us that we might see a man\r\n",
        "belonging to the neighbourhood who was partly insane, and who, roaming\r\n",
        "amongst the castle ruins, usually ran straight towards any strangers as\r\n",
        "if to do them injury; but if we met him we must not be afraid, as he was\r\n",
        "perfectly harmless. We had no desire to meet a madman, and luckily,\r\n",
        "although we kept a sharp look-out, we did not see him. We found the\r\n",
        "ruined castle resting on a rock overlooking the sea with the rolling\r\n",
        "waves dashing on its base below; it was connected with the mainland by a\r\n",
        "very narrow strip broken through in one place, and formerly crossed by a\r\n",
        "drawbridge. As this was no longer available, it was somewhat difficult\r\n",
        "to scale the embankment opposite; still we scrambled up and passed\r\n",
        "triumphantly through the archway into the ruins, not meeting with that\r\n",

        "stated, had been built about the year 1100 by one Buchollie, a famous\r\n",

        "and Druidical circles, a large proportion of the castles lying along the\r\n",

        "out to sea, and then we adjourned to the village inn, where we were\r\n",

        "that county. We afterwards read that Pennant, the celebrated tourist,\r\n",
        "when visiting Caithness in 1769, wrote that at that time there was not\r\n",
        "a single cart, nor mile of road properly so called in the county. He\r\n",
        "described the whole district as little better than an \"immense morass,\r\n",
        "with here and there some fruitful spots of oats and bere (barley), and\r\n",
        "much coarse grass, almost all wild, there being as yet very little\r\n",
        "cultivated.\" And he goes on to add:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "   Here are neither barns nor granaries; the corn is thrashed out and\r\n",
        "   preserved in the chaff in bykes, which are stacks in the shape of\r\n",
        "   beehives thatched quite round. The tender sex (I blush for the\r\n",
        "   Caithnessians) are the only animals of burden; they turn their\r\n",
        "   patient backs to the dunghills and receive in their cassties or straw\r\n",
        "   baskets as much as their lords and masters think fit to fling in with\r\n",
        "   their pitchforks, and then trudge to the fields in droves.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A more modern writer, however, thought that Pennant must have been\r\n",
        "observant but not reflective, and wrote:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "   It is not on the sea coast that woman looks on man as lord and\r\n",
        "   master. The fishing industry more than any other leads to great\r\n",
        "   equality between the sexes. The man is away and the woman conducts\r\n",
        "   all the family affairs on land. Home means all the comfort man can\r\n",
        "   enjoy! His life is one persistent calling for self-reliance and\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "To inland folk like ourselves it was a strange sight to see so many\r\n",
        "women engaged in agricultural pursuits, but we realised that the men had\r\n",

        "one woman mowing oats with a scythe and another following her, gathering\r\n",
        "them up and binding them into sheaves, while several others were cutting\r\n",
        "down the oats with sickles; we saw others driving horses attached to\r\n",
        "carts. The children, or \"bairns,\" as they were called here, wore neither\r\n",
        "shoes nor stockings, except a few of the very young ones, and all the\r\n",

        "An elderly and portly-looking gentleman who was on the road in front of\r\n",
        "us awaited our arrival, and as an introduction politely offered us a\r\n",
        "pinch of snuff out of his well-filled snuff-box, which we accepted. We\r\n",
        "tried to take it, but the application of a small portion to our noses\r\n",
        "caused us to sneeze so violently that the gentleman roared with laughter\r\n",
        "at our expense, and was evidently both surprised and amused at our\r\n",
        "distress. We were soon good friends, however, and he was as pleased with\r\n",
        "our company as we were with his, but we accepted no more pinches of\r\n",
        "snuff in Scotland. He had many inquiries to make about the method of\r\n",
        "farming in Cheshire and regarding the rotation of crops. We informed\r\n",
        "him that potatoes were the first crop following grass grown in our\r\n",
        "neighbourhood, followed by wheat in the next year, and oats and clover\r\n",
        "afterwards--the clover being cut for two years. \"And how many years\r\n",
        "before wheat again?\" he asked; but this question we could not answer, as\r\n",
        "we were not sufficiently advanced in agricultural knowledge to undergo a\r\n",
        "very serious examination from one who was evidently inclined to dive\r\n",
        "deeply into the subject. As we walked along, we noticed a stone on the\r\n",
        "slope of a mountain like those we had seen at Stenness in the Orkneys,\r\n",
        "but no halo of interest could be thrown around it by our friend, who\r\n",
        "simply said it had been there \"since the world began.\" Near Lybster we\r\n",
        "had a good view of the Ord of Caithness, a black-looking ridge of\r\n",
        "mountains terminating in the Maiden's Paps, which were later to be\r\n",

        "a monster whale, forming an arch ornamented in the centre by a portion\r\n",
        "of the backbone of the same creature. In the dark the only objects we\r\n",
        "could distinguish were the rocks on the right and the lights of two\r\n",

        "discover; he knew Warrington and the neighbourhood, had visited Mr. Lyon\r\n",
        "of Appleton Hall near that town, and knew Mr. Patten of Bank Hall, who\r\n",

        "and fortunately we did not neglect it on this occasion, for it proved\r\n",
        "one of the worst day's walks that we ever experienced. Helmsdale was our\r\n",
        "next stage, and a direct road led to it along the coast, a distance of\r\n",

        "sport amongst the grouse, though he consoled himself by claiming that it\r\n",
        "had been one of the finest sporting seasons ever known in Caithness. As\r\n",

        "to each gun, besides other game. The average weight of grouse on the\r\n",
        "Scotch moors was twenty-five ounces, but those on the Caithness moors\r\n",
        "were heavier, and averaged twenty-five and a half ounces.\r\n",

        "He was curious to know where we were going, and when we told him, he\r\n",
        "said we were attempting an impossible feat in such awful weather, and\r\n",
        "strongly advised us to return to the hotel, and try the journey on a\r\n",

        "we did not feel their pressure like our friend the sportsman, who was\r\n",
        "going in the opposite direction. At last we came to what might be called\r\n",
        "a village, where there were a few scattered houses and a burial-ground,\r\n",
        "but no kirk that we could see. Near here we crossed a stream known as\r\n",
        "Berriedale Water, and reached the last house, a farm, where our track\r\n",
        "practically ended. We knocked at the door, which was opened by the\r\n",
        "farmer himself, and his wife soon provided us with tea and oatmeal cake,\r\n",
        "which we enjoyed after our seven or eight-mile walk. The wind howled in\r\n",

        "the place we had arrived at was named Braemore, and that on the other\r\n",
        "side of the hills, which they had never crossed themselves, there was a\r\n",
        "forest with no roads through it, and if we got there, we should have to\r\n",
        "make our way as best we could across the moors to Helmsdale. They showed\r\n",
        "us the best way to reach the foot of the mountain, but we found the\r\n",
        "going much worse than we anticipated, since the storm had now developed\r\n",
        "into one of great magnitude. Fortunately the wind was behind us, but the\r\n",
        "higher we ascended the stronger it became, and it fairly took our breath\r\n",
        "away even when we turned our heads towards it sideways, which made us\r\n",
        "realise how impossible it was for us to turn back, however much we\r\n",
        "might wish to do so; consequently we struggled onwards, occasionally\r\n",
        "taking advantage of the shelter of some projecting rock to recover our\r\n",
        "breathing--a very necessary proceeding, for as we approached the summit\r\n",
        "the rain became more like sleet, the wind was very cold, and the rocks\r\n",
        "were in a frozen and slippery condition. We were in great danger of\r\n",
        "being blown over and losing our lives, and as we could no longer walk\r\n",
        "upright in safety, we knelt down, not without a prayer to heaven as we\r\n",
        "continued on our way. Thus we crawled along upon our hands and knees\r\n",
        "over the smooth wind-swept summit of the Maiden's Paps, now one immense\r\n",
        "surface of ice. The last bit was the worst of all, for here the raging\r\n",
        "elements struck us with full and uninterrupted force. We crossed this\r\n",
        "inches at a time, lying flat on the smooth rock with our faces\r\n",
        "downwards. Our feelings of thankfulness to the Almighty may be imagined\r\n",

        "and, as it was, in spite of the rain we could see a long distance, but\r\n",
        "the prospect was far from encouraging. A great black rock, higher than\r\n",
        "that we had climbed, stood before us, with its summit hidden in the\r\n",
        "clouds, and a wide expanse of hills and moors, but not a house or tree\r\n",
        "so far as the eye could reach. This rather surprised us, as we expected\r\n",
        "the forest region to be covered with trees which would afford us some\r\n",
        "shelter on our farther way. We learned afterwards that the \"forest\" was\r\n",
        "but a name, the trees having disappeared ages ago from most of these\r\n",
        "forests in the northern regions of Scotland.\r\n",

        "difficult and dangerous. It looked an awful place below us--a wild\r\n",
        "amphitheatre of dreary hills and moors!\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We had no compass to guide us, and in the absence of light from the sun\r\n",
        "we could not tell in what direction we were travelling, so with our\r\n",
        "backs towards the hills we had crossed, we made our way across the bog,\r\n",
        "now saturated with water. We could hear it gurgling under our feet at\r\n",
        "every stride, even when we could not see it, and occasionally we slipped\r\n",
        "into holes nearly knee-deep in water. After floundering in the bog for\r\n",
        "some time, and not knowing which way to turn, as we appeared to be\r\n",
        "surrounded with hills, we decided to try to walk against the wind which\r\n",
        "was blowing from the sea, for we knew that if we could reach the coast\r\n",
        "we should also reach the highway, which ran alongside it. But we soon\r\n",
        "had to give in, for we came to great rocks impossible for us to scale,\r\n",
        "so we had to abandon this direction and try another. The rain still\r\n",
        "continued, and our hands had now been bleached quite white with the rain\r\n",
        "beating on them, just like those of a washerwoman after a heavy day's\r\n",
        "washing. We knew that the night would shortly be coming on, and the\r\n",
        "terrible thought of a dark night on the moors began to haunt us. If we\r\n",
        "could only have found a track we should not have cared, but we were now\r\n",
        "really LOST.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We were giving way to despair and beginning to think it might be a\r\n",
        "question of life or death when a bright thought suddenly struck us, and\r\n",
        "we wondered why we had not thought of it before. Why not follow the\r\n",
        "water, which would be sure to be running towards the sea? This idea\r\n",
        "inspired us with hope, and seemed to give us new life; but it was\r\n",
        "astonishing what a time elapsed before we found a running stream, for\r\n",
        "the water appeared to remain where it fell. At length we came to a small\r\n",
        "stream, the sight of which gave us renewed energy, and we followed it\r\n",
        "joyfully on its downward course. Presently we saw a few small bushes;\r\n",
        "then we came to a larger stream, and afterwards to a patch of grassland\r\n",
        "which clearly at one time had been under cultivation. At last we came to\r\n",
        "trees under which we could see some deer sheltering from the storm: by\r\n",
        "this time the stream had become a raging torrent. We stood watching the\r\n",
        "deer for a moment, when suddenly three fine stags rushed past us and\r\n",
        "dashed into the surging waters of the stream, which carried them down a\r\n",
        "considerable distance before they could land on its rocky bank on the\r\n",
        "other side. It was an exciting adventure, as the stags were so near us,\r\n",
        "and with their fine antlers presented an imposing appearance.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We now crossed over some heather in order to reach a small path which we\r\n",
        "could see alongside the swollen river. How pleased we were when we knew\r\n",
        "we were out of danger! It seemed to us like an escape from a terrible\r\n",
        "fate. We remembered how Mungo Park, when alone in the very heart of\r\n",
        "Africa, and in the midst of a great wilderness, derived consolation from\r\n",
        "very much smaller sources than the few trees which now cheered us on our\r\n",
        "way. The path became broader as we passed through the grounds of Lord\r\n",
        "Galloway's hunting-box, and we soon reached the highway, where we\r\n",
        "crossed the boiling torrent rushing along with frightful rapidity on its\r\n",
        "way to the sea. The shades of night were coming on as we knocked at the\r\n",
        "door of the keeper's cottage, and judge of our surprise when we were\r\n",
        "informed that, after walking from ten o'clock in the morning to six\r\n",
        "o'clock at night, we were only about six miles from Dunbeath, whence we\r\n",
        "had started that morning, and had still about ten miles to walk before\r\n",
        "we could reach Helmsdale.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We were almost famished with hunger, but we were lucky enough to secure\r\n",
        "a splendid tea at the keeper's cottage. Fortunately for us the good lady\r\n",
        "of the house had provided a sumptuous repast for some sporting gentlemen\r\n",
        "she was expecting, but who had been prevented from coming owing to the\r\n",
        "storm. We kept no record of our gastronomical performances on this\r\n",
        "occasion, but we can safely state that of a whole rabbit very little\r\n",

        "down on a stone and awaited us until we got within speaking distance,\r\n",
        "when he began to talk to us. He was the Inspector of Roads, and had been\r\n",

        "the day. He said he liked to speak to everybody he saw, as the roads\r\n",
        "were so very lonely in his district. He informed us that the Half-Way\r\n",

        "   rude sculpture within the castle represents Sir John Monteith in an\r\n",
        "   attitude of despair, lamenting his former treachery), captured by\r\n",

        "And we have been told that it was the birthplace of Taliesin, the early\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "In former times the castle of Dumbarton was looked upon as one of the\r\n",
        "strongest places in the world, and, rising precipitously from the level\r\n",
        "plain, it appeared to us to be quite impregnable. Captain Crawford's\r\n",
        "feat in capturing this castle equals anything else of the kind recorded\r\n",
        "in history. In the time of Queen Elizabeth of England, when a quarrel\r\n",

        "was only one access to the castle, approached by 365 steps, but these\r\n",
        "were strongly guarded and fortified. The captain took advantage of a\r\n",
        "misty and moonless night to bring his scaling-ladders to the foot of the\r\n",
        "rock at the opposite side, where it was the most precipitous, and\r\n",
        "consequently the least guarded by the soldiers at the top. The choice of\r\n",
        "this side of the rock was fortunate, as the first ladder broke with the\r\n",
        "weight of the men who attempted to climb it, and the noise of the fall\r\n",
        "must have betrayed them if they had been on the other and more guarded\r\n",
        "side. Crawford, who was assisted by a soldier who had deserted from the\r\n",
        "castle, renewed the attempt in person, and, having scrambled up a\r\n",
        "projecting ledge of rock, fastened the ladder by tying it to the roots\r\n",
        "of a tree which grew midway up the rock. Here they found a footing for\r\n",
        "the whole party, which was, of course, small in number. In scaling the\r\n",
        "second precipice, however, one of the party was seized with an\r\n",
        "epileptic fit, to which he was subject, brought on, perhaps, by terror\r\n",
        "in the act of climbing the ladder. He could neither ascend nor descend;\r\n",
        "moreover, if they had thrown him down, apart from the cruelty of the\r\n",
        "thing, the fall of his body might have alarmed the garrison. Crawford,\r\n",
        "therefore, ordered him to be tied fast to one side of the ladder, and,\r\n",
        "turning it round, they mounted with ease. When the party gained the\r\n",
        "summit, they slew the sentinel before he had time to give the alarm, and\r\n",
        "easily surprised the slumbering garrison, who had trusted too much to\r\n",

        "which my brother measured in six long strides as being eighteen feet in\r\n",
