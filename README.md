Tutorials on Authorship Analysis

This repository contains tutorials on how to perform authorship analysis.
I'll be focusing on python tutorials through the ipython notebook, but am happy to take pull requests for others wishing to add tutorials in other languages.
Tutorials should be self-contained, with links to any external resources (namely, datasets).
